## 🤔 What I Do

I write code for one reason: **curiosity**. If something looks technically challenging or makes me wonder "how does that even work?", I'm already halfway through rebuilding it.

I'm that person who:
- 🧩 Takes things apart to see the pieces
- ⚡ Gets excited about optimization rabbit holes
- 🎯 Codes like I'm solving a puzzle (because I am)
- 🧼 Believes clean code is happy code
- 🔬 Treats programming like a science experiment

```cpp
while (curious) {
    learn();
    build();
    break_it();
    fix_it();
    optimize();
    repeat();
}
```

## 💻 My Playground

**Languages I Speak** (to computers, anyway)

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=cplusplus&logoColor=white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

*C++ is my main squeeze, Python's my side quest*

**Tools I Actually Use**

![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)
![Neovim](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neovim-57A143?style=for-the-badge&logo=neovim&logoColor=white)

*Yes, I use Neovim. No, I don't remember how to exit Vim either*

## 🌎 Random Facts

- 📍 Based in Panama 🇵🇦
- 🗣️ Fluent in Spanish, survival-level English
- 🎮 If it can be simulated, I'll probably try to code it
- 🐛 More time debugging = more learning (that's my story and I'm sticking to it)

## 💭 Current Status

```python
status = {
    "working_on": "Whatever caught my attention today",
    "learning": "How things break (and how to unbreak them)",
    "vibe": "Perpetually curious 🔍"
}
```
